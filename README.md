# diabeties_ml_project

This project takes the following dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database, and uses PyTorch to create a Nerual Network model to predict results when given data. By training and validating the model it was able to accuratly predict the result with a training accuracy of 85.23% and validation accuracy of 82.81%.

Below you will find the ipynb file labeled (insert file name here) which contains all the different methods used to be able to create and train the model. Note to run the file you will need your own Kaggle API token. https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api

You will also see the deployable website which can be viewed at the following link: rajShukla2002.pythonanywhere.com
